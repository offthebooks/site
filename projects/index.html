        <h3>Crispnes</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
        Crispnes is a web-based pixel editor and animation app. It&rsquo;s currently in an alpha state. It requires a fairly modern browser environment, and works best as an app saved to your homescreen. It should work offline after first loading it, and it saves your work with the IndexedDB API.
      </p>
      <p>
        As pre-release software, make sure to use the export-to-PNG features or screen recording to save creations you&rsquo;re happy with.

        <h3>Churro: Defender of Darnwood</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
        Churro: Defender of Darnwood is a retro-inspired platform game starring Churro, a neighborly yellow bird who throws herself into a rescue mission on behalf of her community. She comes from Darnwood Grove, in a world where everything is made of knit fabric.
      </p>
      <p>
        Linked above is an early prototype where you can test gameplay mechanics through a single introductory level with pests, pits, yarn-ball collectibles, and a cozy atmosphere. Authentic, cheerful, 8-bit chiptune music and sound effects accompany the upscaled pixel-art graphics. You can read more about <a href="/blog/post/churros-awakening">Churro</a> and the <a href="/blog/post/knit-and-tidy">knit upscaled effect</a> for the game on the <a href="/blog/">Off The Books blog</a>.

        <h3>Build-A-Bird</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
        During <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird">Flappy Bird&rsquo;s</a> peak popularity, every app store was being flooded with clones. Build-A-Bird is itself a parody of the act of making clones. Supplying images for the main components of the game, you can create your own clone with little effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        It&rsquo;s an anti-pattern for how to make a game on the web, but it still works fairly well. Because very few people have used their own images, I added friendlier default art to make the game more approachable. You can simply hit &ldquo;play&rdquo;, and jump in if you just want to give the game a shot.

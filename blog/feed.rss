      <![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a long time coming, but after a quick round of feedback from some early friends-and-family testers, <em>Churro: Defender of Darnwood</em> now has a <a href="https://offthebooksgames.itch.io/churro">prototype up on itch.io</a>!</p>
      <p>The build contains a single intro level that loops after you complete it. All told probably 5 minutes of gameplay if we&rsquo;re being generous. It&rsquo;s just enough to get a feel for play mechanics, and have a little fun double-jumping and dashing around. If you&rsquo;re curious enough to give the prototype a try, Churro would love to hear what you think.</p>

      <p>Donations are available if anyone is excited enough to want to contribute to development. However, please do <strong>not</strong> feel bad bypassing &ldquo;donate&rdquo; to download. It&rsquo;s a very brief glimpse, and not what I&rsquo;d expect anybody to part with hard earned money to play.</p>
      <p>Very thankful for anyone who takes interest, and would be glad to hear any feedback you might have.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>Dots and lines brought the first video games to life, leaving the heavy lifting to our imaginations. Today, trillions of operations bring linear algebra to bear on unsuspecting triangles every second, giving incredible fidelity to the state of the art.</p>
      <p>Graphics and gameplay evolved together, but each has a distinct lineage. Yesterday&rsquo;s platforms have a lot of life left in them, and decades of innovation in game design surface in retro games every week. There are also more ways to play older games than ever before. It’s a bright day for fans of retro games.</p>
      <p>Much work has gone into replicating older games precisely for nostalgia and preservation. Shaders can recreate the look of CRT and LCD screens well. Nintendo Switch Online and FPGA consoles like Analogue Pocket have display modes for this. Even more options are available for emulators, so players can get the look they remember from that 13 inch Zenith in their childhood basement.</p>
      <p>We <em>should</em> have ways to play games designed for CRT screens that reflect their original experiences, but modern pixel art games have a wide opening for new artistic expressions. While occasional 3D games get a unique and naturalistic treatment, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ōkami">Ōkami</a> being a standout example, few pixel art games go beyond nearest-neighbor upscaling apart from occasional CRT or scanline shaders.</p>
      <p>Years ago, while browsing my feeds, I came across a meme with cross-stitched artwork. The specifics of the post didn’t stick, but what <em>did</em> was how similar cross-stitching and pixel art are. Cross-stitched artwork has a quaint and endearing quality, and it’s never criticized for its low resolution.</p>
      <p>One day curiosity got the better of me, and I mocked up some concepts to visualize my realization. Some options I considered were crocheted fabric, glass tiles, or other tile/masonry patterns, but ultimately I felt like cross-stitching and knit fabric would be the most recognizable. Below are some of my early tests. The Link&rsquo;s Awakening tests are 720p, an upscale of 5x (zoom in for detail).</p>
      <p><img src="/blog/media/ladx-cross-stitch.png" alt="Mockup of a cross-stitch upscaled frame from Link&rsquo;s Awakening DX." /></p>

      <p><img src="/blog/media/mm2-knit-fabric.png" alt="Mockup of a knit fabric upscaled frame from Mega Man 2 for NES." /></p>
      <p>First takeaway was that smaller input dimensions had better results. Game Boy frames at 160 x 144 could sell the effect better than 256 x 240 NES screens. Also, the knit pattern appeared more distinct than the cross-stitched look at these sizes. Perhaps due to the alternating pattern between neighboring pixels.</p>
      <p>Some of my favorite recent gaming experiences have been wholesome and cozy titles, and I&rsquo;ve been wanting to create something similarly comforting and approachable. A warm knit sweater really meshes with their chill vibe. This was exactly the tone I had in mind for Churro&rsquo;s Pico-8 project I had been tinkering with, so that was an obvious next mockup.</p>
      <p><img src="/blog/media/churro-knit-test.gif" alt="Animated walk cycle of Churro, a little yellow bird, testing a manually applied upscale to look like knit fabric." /></p>
      <p>This look was more compelling to me than the purely pixel art based project I&rsquo;d been working on, and I&rsquo;d recently been getting acquainted with <a href="https://godotengine.org">Godot</a>. The tools and editor would make building a lot faster. After a bit of tinkering, a shader for this knit look had become pretty convincing after just a few evenings. After arriving at specs to help heighten the look (160 x 90 pixels, with sound and colors inspired by the NES), and working out some early details in test levels, some friends suggested finding a way to make the game thematically match the aesthetic.</p>

      <p>Introducing <em>Churro: Defender of Darnwood</em>, a warm-and-fuzzy retro platformer. There is a lot still in flux about the game, but there are some fun play mechanics, a few rudimentary tilesets, sound effects, and songs for two of the worlds. There is a light story scenario planned, typical of platform games, and a number of in-progress designs for different pests, hazards, and bosses. What follows is an external link to a short teaser, with a first look at the progress on the visuals and the first test level. It&rsquo;s been fun sharing about development, and I wanted to be able to share progress without continuing to obscure the style.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m not expecting to be able to stick to a rigid timeline, especially working in my free hours. Frankly, I&rsquo;m not even sure what platforms to target a release for, but this project will be the primary focus of my game development time for the foreseeable future.</p>
      <p>The indie community online has been such a fun and welcoming space as I get back into game development, particularly on Mastodon.

    <title>Churro&#8217;s Awakening</title>

      <![CDATA[<p>The active project around here is a 2D retro platform game starring <em>Churro</em>, an eight-by-eight pixel birdie. Unless you&rsquo;ve been following <em>Off The Books</em> elsewhere, you probably haven&rsquo;t seen her around before. Here&rsquo;s some background on our feathered heroine to get you up to speed.</p>
      <p><img class="pixel" src="/blog/media/churro-blink.png" alt="Yellow pixel-art bird." /></p>
      <p>Her first design came from reviving an old project, <em><a href="https://offthebooks.games/build-a-bird">Build-A-Bird</a></em>. During <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird">Flappy Bird&rsquo;s</a></em> peak popularity, every app store was being flooded with clones. It was everywhere, and I had the idea to parody the act of making clones itself. Letting people supply images for the main components of the game, they could create their own clone with little effort. It also was a chance to test the mobile web as a game platform. The initial game had bland artwork, intending to nudge you into supplying your own, but few people bothered to participate in the gag.</p>
      <p>Back in March, it occurred to me that <em>Build-a-Bird</em> would be fun to bring back. JavaScript had come a long way over the last ten years, and while the project is mostly a series of game dev anti-patterns, it was pretty easy to clean up. Because very few people had used their own images, adding friendlier default art felt like a way to make the game more approachable. I had recently worked with low color 8x8 tiles while <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@OffTheBooks/111970184615755837">exploring NES development</a>, and Churro was first pecked out in a custom tile editor (a topic for another day), using colors from the NES palette.</p>
      <p><img src="/blog/media/build-a-bird-screen.png" alt="Screen capture from Build-a-Bird game." /></p>
      <p>Churro&rsquo;s name and her first few animations came while exploring <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">PICO-8</a>. Trying to start up a project for the NES had been fun, but it was clear that building a new game there would carry some heavy costs. With limited time for development, other platforms deserved a look. Hosting many simple retro games, and carrying similar low spec art requirements, I thought PICO-8 was a good place to start.</p>
      <p>Working with PICO-8 one weekend coincidentally lined up with a <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/55/">Ludum Dare</a> game jam. Despite not fitting the theme or completing a project, &ldquo;jamming&rdquo; at the same time as other game developers was energizing. <em>Chirpy Churro</em> ended up being little more than a single stage demo, but Churro seemed right at home as a platform game protagonist. Even those early gameplay mechanics were enjoyable, which was a great first spark for the project. If it&rsquo;s fun to simply move around in a game, that&rsquo;s more than half the battle.</p>
      <p><img class="pixel" src="/blog/media/chirpy-churro.png" alt="Screen capture from Chirpy Churro PICO-8 demo." /></p>
      <p>Quickly, ambitions for what a game with Churro could look like pushed against some of PICO-8&rsquo;s constraints. Even though a low spec game is still the plan, some of the harder limitations and lack of robust tools were going to hold some of the best ideas back.</p>
      <p>Recent interactions with developers online brought along a lot of exposure to <a href="https://godotengine.org">Godot</a>, an open-source engine. It&rsquo;s overwhelmingly well regarded by people who work with it. Most of my previous experience has been with custom engines, but Godot comes with a full toolset that makes getting started really quick. After watching some tutorials and doing some tinkering, a test level was up and running in just a few hours.</p>
      <p>Godot is a fully featured engine with a fantastic system for composing game objects using nodes in a scene tree, and it has a large and growing support community. The repository and first commits for Churro&rsquo;s latest incarnation went up on June 28th, and it&rsquo;s carrying the most momentum on a personal project I&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
      <p>There&rsquo;s no target date or roadmap yet, but there are more fun things yet to show about the project. If a chill retro platformer is in your wheelhouse, it should be fun to follow along.

      <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the Off The Books Blog. Here you&rsquo;ll find posts on the video game industry, development progress, and related anecdotes.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s 2024, do we really still do blogs?&rdquo; Frankly, there aren&rsquo;t enough of them. Sometimes, writing needs a little space to breathe, a moment to calm itself down, and something sturdier than the ever shifting sands of social media.</p>
      <p>There are fun things ahead to share, and leaving behind some additional context for posterity feels worth the effort.</p>
      <p>In any case, thanks for dropping by, and hope to see you again soon!</p>]]>

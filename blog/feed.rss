      <![CDATA[<p>Having been a fan of Nintendo, effectively, my entire life, it&rsquo;s hard to keep myself from ruminating on the upcoming launch of Switch 2 and the things we might see. This post collects my thoughts from the last few months around the upcoming Direct. There is zero insider information, just some &ldquo;reading the tea leaves&rdquo; of Nintendo&rsquo;s past and present.</p>
      <h3>
        <p>Challenges</p>
      </h3>
      <p>There are a few things working against Nintendo for this launch, most notably with price and perception. These difficulties undoubtedly factor into how they&rsquo;ll be positioning Switch 2, so they are good to keep in mind.</p>
      <p>There are more economic pressures than usual on Nintendo right now. Between component constraints, tariff threats, and the yen roughly the weakest it&rsquo;s been during a console launch, Nintendo can&rsquo;t have had an easy time arriving at a price point for Switch 2. Previously, I&rsquo;d have put money on $349 as a continuity of their position making gaming accessible to families. They aren&rsquo;t cutting out more affordable Switch options though, and their brand new console doesn&rsquo;t need to hit the mainstream audience quite as hard as the Wii had to. It wouldn&rsquo;t be too surprising to see it priced anywhere up to $449 at this point. It&rsquo;s not unreasonable to think they still want to come in well under a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X though. If I had to put a number on it, $389 feels about right to me.</p>
      <p>There is also a sentiment going around that there&rsquo;s not enough new here to warrant an upgrade. Nintendo isn&rsquo;t the only strong option for handheld gaming the way it was when the Switch first launched. There is a sizeable wait-and-see crowd that thinks Switch 2 still has to prove itself, and others are crying <em>2 Little 2 Late</em>.</p>
      <h3>
        <p>Opportunities</p>
      </h3>
      <p>Nintendo smashed back into the gaming zeitgeist with the original Switch, and the last eight years have continued to be full of discussions, rumors, and leaks. Many eyes are on Nintendo, and they can&rsquo;t afford for this presentation to fall flat. You can find reaction videos from past announcements that leave fans in stunned excitement, and Nintendo will be trying to fill this Direct with many of these moments. There are opportunities to &ldquo;break the Internet&rdquo; with potential announcements here. Expect Nintendo to pull out all the stops.</p>
      <p>There are two strategies that could bolster the momentum of the Switch into this next generation. These bets could be wrong, but they play into a number of my game predictions.</p>
      <p>Nintendo traditionally releases a game, and moves on to what&rsquo;s next. They tiptoed into the arena of supporting games with continued updates this generation with a mix of short- and long-term DLC. Big franchises like <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> and <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> saw updates that spanned multiple years with new characters and content. Other titles like <em>Animal Crossing</em> and <em>Super Mario Maker 2</em> let some fans down with minor or brief support. Nintendo is likely planning for Switch 2 to be as long-lived as the original Switch, so we might see some key franchises get support throughout the Switch 2 generation.</p>
      <p>While game announcements from Nintendo have gone cold in the lead-up to Switch 2, there are still 150 million people out there with an original Switch. Quite possibly, a few thousand customers bought one just yesterday. Nintendo put all their eggs in one basket, combining their mobile and home consoles, and they&rsquo;ll want a smooth transition to carry customers forward. People have discussed how they&rsquo;ll handle new games on Switch 2 without abandoning the huge existing customer base. My gut says they&rsquo;ll adopt a strategy we&rsquo;ve seen before. I&rsquo;m referring, of course, to the Game Boy DX line of games. Games compatible with the original Game Boy, but with color and other enhancements for Game Boy Color.</p>
      <p>That&rsquo;s a good segue into talking about games, with the only original Switch title we can be fairly certain will make some manner of appearance on April 2nd.</p>
      <h3>
        <p>Metroid Prime 4</p>
      </h3>
      <p>Nintendo first announced <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> with a logo in the early days of the Switch. Despite its tumultuous development history, it has been reiterated as a Switch title. Some have suggested this might be a “dual SKU” game that has separate Switch and Switch 2 versions a la <em>Twilight Princess</em> (GameCube and Wii) and <em>Breath of the Wild</em> (Wii U and Switch). While I don&rsquo;t expect two versions of this game on shelves, I also wouldn&rsquo;t expect it to be merely a standard Switch game when played on Switch 2. Prime 4 isn&rsquo;t itself a reason to justify a separate DX-like line of software release. However, the Switch is still an actively developed console, and offering game makers a means to bridge current efforts onto the new console would make sense for everyone. Allowing for potential features like enhanced performance or DLSS upscaled resolutions, while still allowing games to reach the huge Switch user base, is a win-win-win for Nintendo, developers, and customers.</p>
      <h3>
        <p>Mario Kart</p>
      </h3>
      <p>Being the first Switch 2 footage we&rsquo;ve seen, Mario Kart is nearly a mortal lock to be a launch title. <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> is second only to <em>Wii Sports</em> as Nintendo&rsquo;s best-selling game of all time, and Wii Sports was certainly boosted by being a pack-in game from day one of Wii sales. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has been one of the most successful titles to get ongoing support, and it could really prop up Switch Online subscriptions to have continued support for Mario Kart on Switch 2. It could get new tracks, updates, and characters throughout the life of the console. Being a strong multiplayer experience though, we&rsquo;ll need some other big titles while we wait for friends to get a Switch 2.</p>
      <h3>
        <p>Mario</p>
      </h3>
      <p><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> tops many Mario tier lists, and <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> was a great surprise to get late in the Switch cycle. Certainly though, someone has been working on a new 3D Mario for years, and now is the time to see it. My gut says it won&rsquo;t be Odyssey 2. I might stray from the majority opinion here, but Bowser&rsquo;s Fury was a strong prototype for a potential future direction for Mario. While Mario may not benefit from an open world the same way that Zelda does, it&rsquo;s a direction they&rsquo;ve certainly considered. As a long shot, Mario Galaxy 3 is the game I&rsquo;d like to see. It&rsquo;s a flexible formula that still has much to explore. This would also pair nicely with the <em>Super Mario Galaxy 2</em> release that was sorely missed on Switch if they need a holdover before an original release is ready.</p>
      <h3>
        <p>Zelda</p>
      </h3>
      <p>Unless they’re straying far from historical precedent, we won’t see a new 3D Zelda game at launch. There simply hasn&rsquo;t been enough time. However, <em>Breath of the Wild</em> was inexorably bound to the launch of the Switch, and they know people will be looking for Zelda to make some kind of appearance. There have been rumors of enhanced versions of BotW or TotK, but those are recent games that will already be playable on Switch 2. They wouldn&rsquo;t really add excitement or drama to the presentation, but you know what would? Finally launching the <em>Wind Waker</em> and <em>Twilight Princess</em> ports that we have not stopped talking about for more than 6 years.</p>
      <h3>
        <p>Silksong</p>
      </h3>
      <p>Possibly the only thing as hotly anticipated than the Zelda remakes and the Switch 2 itself, the follow-up to <em>Hollow Knight</em> comes up before nearly every Nintendo Direct. Strictly speaking, Nintendo and Team Cherry don&rsquo;t need each other, but this Direct would put a lot of eyes on Silksong from a broader Switch audience. Simultaneously, news about Silksong is in such demand, that it would bring a ton of PC and core gamer eyeballs that are already inclined to look past the Switch 2. Any official release information about Silksong is undoubtedly going to command millions of views. And if I&rsquo;m right about a cross-compatible software option with Switch 2 enhancements, this is a great third-party candidate.</p>
      <h3>
        <p>Animal Crossing</p>
      </h3>
      <p>Admittedly, this prediction is out there, but the team that made <em>Splatoon 3</em> and <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> has certainly been working on something. These two games are now some of Nintendo&rsquo;s heaviest hitters, but here’s why I’m leaning towards Animal Crossing. Splatoon is a huge franchise, but the Switch has already seen two Splatoon games. It has not caught on as well in the US, and for better or worse, Nintendo seems to come out strong for Western audiences to secure global interest. Animal Crossing is another great candidate for long-term updates, events, and support through Switch Online. New Horizons was a huge cultural moment due to the Covid pandemic. And while few people are still isolating at home, the world is full of reasons to seek the escape of picking fruit and catching fish with your favorite villagers.</p>
      <h3>
        <p>And the rest</p>
      </h3>
      <p>Another thing to count on is the unexpected. If we&rsquo;ve learned nothing from Labo, Alarmo, and Nintendo Music, it seems like Nintendo loves to bring something out of left field. What could be the Arms or 1-2-Switch of this launch? Mario Paint remake using the new mouse functionality? Sakurai&rsquo;s secret project?</p>
      <p>There are some major franchises on this list, and we&rsquo;ll see a number of them in the Direct. We shouldn&rsquo;t expect much more than two to be available at launch however. Keeping momentum for Switch 2 depends on people seeing a steady flow of games in the pipeline, and each of these titles would deserve some space to breathe. Not to mention, there has continued to be a steady flow of indies, and those will begin moving to Switch 2 as well.</p>
      <p>It seems we&rsquo;re long past the days of the 5-year console cycle. For fans of Nintendo, this is what we&rsquo;ll be working with for a while. Here&rsquo;s to hoping Switch 2 lives up to our many great expectations.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>My opinion isn&rsquo;t excessively sought after, but occasionally, someone asks me how they should learn to make games.</p>
      <p>My children charge into the playroom we&rsquo;ve asked them to clean, and crumble under the weight of such a daunting request. The reality of their task however, is iterating on something they know very well how to do. Find an out-of-place toy, and put it where it belongs. When they get into that frame of mind, it&rsquo;s easier to confidently approach their chore.</p>
      <p>The biggest challenge of game development is not organizing a mental framework of physics, graphics, or networking. Regardless of how much prior education or experience you bring to making a game, every project will go through hundreds of cycles hitting an obstacle, discovering a viable solution, and continuing the journey.</p>
      <p>Putting a toy away may seem simplistic compared with the tasks of building a game, but conceptually, you need to get in the same headspace. The more iterations of problem solving you go through, the more natural <em>your</em> process will become, and the better prepared you will feel for, well, everything.</p>
      <p>This boils down to the core of my recommendation for anyone wanting to &ldquo;learn to make games.&rdquo; Start making one. All games shift and take shape in the making, and run into many unforeseen challenges. Far more than sorting an object tree, or whatever, overcoming those challenges is what making games looks like.</p>
      <p>Don&rsquo;t know what you want to make? Find some indie games you like, and look at the tools their creators are using. Then follow a tutorial, or try to copy something you really enjoyed. If you still can&rsquo;t come up with something, are you sure you want to make games?</p>
      <p>The following analogy is more subtractive than the nature of building a game, but it still leaves a good picture of the creative mentality to hang onto. It&rsquo;s a small bit of wisdom from the sage of late twentieth century America, Wilson, the kindly neighbor from Home Improvement.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Tim: What&rsquo;re you doin&rsquo;?</p>
        <p>Wilson: Just carving out a canoe, Tim.</p>
        <p>Tim: ...Sounds hard.</p>
        <p>Wilson: Not really, Tim &mdash; you just take a big block of wood, and chip away everything that&rsquo;s not a canoe.</p>
      </blockquote>]]>

    <title>Scribblenauts Keycaps</title>
    <link>https://offthebooks.games/blog/post/scribblenauts-keycaps</link>
    <pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 00:00:51 GMT</pubDate>
    <description>
      <![CDATA[<p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribblenauts_(video_game)">Scribblenauts</a></em> will likely to go down as the most acclaimed game of my career. It won <em>Overall Best of Show</em> at E3 2009 from both IGN and GameSpot, beating out the likes of <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, <em>Uncharted 2</em>, <em>God of War 3</em>, <em>Modern Warfare 2</em>, and many others. This, on top of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyWqwzGObiU">many other accolades</a>, both before and after release.</p>
      <p>The gameplay may not live up to its glowing reception, but the hook of &ldquo;you can create anything&rdquo; certainly grabbed peoples&rsquo; attention. It was driven further into the public consciousness by <a href="https://scribble.fandom.com/wiki/Post_217">NeoGaf Post 217</a> (contains &ldquo;colorful&rdquo; language). Not all of what was described in the post was even possible in the E3 demo, but the experience left an impression on forum member &ldquo;Feep&rdquo; all the same. We tried to fulfill the promise of the post for those who would eventually try it themselves, even including &ldquo;post two seventeen&rdquo; as one of the games spawnable objects.</p>
      <p>With all the love Scribblenauts was getting, you may think great attention would have been given to every detail. But 5TH Cell was not a large company, and the team was split, developing both Scribblenauts and a follow up to Drawn to Life at the same time.</p>
      <p>The concept originally had you scribbling in a notepad to spawn objects. While that made it into the game, state-of-the-art handwriting recognition on a Nintendo DS was not great. An on-screen keyboard was thrown together quickly as an alternative. It ended up being a better experience, and unanimously became the default for creating new items. For the longest time, the characters on the keyboard were plain, Arial or something similar. I didn&rsquo;t retain any significant backups after leaving the company, and I haven&rsquo;t been able to turn up any pre-release screenshots to corroborate. The plain keycaps felt misaligned with the &ldquo;scribble&rdquo; in Scribblenauts, now that the keyboard was the default.</p>
      <p>Around this time, my eyes had been opened to the wider world of design by the documentary, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica_(film)">Helvetica</a></em>. I was freshly aware of the impact of the typefaces all around us, and so I talked up wanting an updated keyboard. There was some agreement from people I mentioned it to, but it was clear nobody wanted to allocate development time to make it happen. Over a few days of light, after hours work, I drew up a new set of letters for the keyboard. As a programmer, there weren&rsquo;t any professional tools at hand for this. The letters themselves were drawn in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paint.NET">Paint.NET</a>. On the weekend, I came in and updated the keyboard in the codebase while nobody was around to tell me otherwise. We didn&rsquo;t have a rigid code review process at this stage in the game. It wasn&rsquo;t perfect, but when everybody got around to seeing the changes, it was generally recognized as a step forward.</p>
      <p><img class="pixel" src="/blog/media/scribblenauts-keyboard.png" alt="Screen capture of the Scribblenauts touch screen keyboard." /></p>
      <p>It felt like our game was going to be a big deal, and I wouldn&rsquo;t have been happy leaving the keyboard unchanged. The end result is still not completely satisfying, the O and D are too similar for one thing. But it was apparent that nobody else cared enough to make a change, especially considering we kept the characters as-is in the sequel.</p>
      <p>Of all the things I worked on over the course of development, this one bit of effort, completely outside my normal responsibilities, stands out most in my memory. Your ideas might not always be met with unanimous excitement, but if they matter to you, you might not want to leave it to someone else. You deserve to be satisfied with your work.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a long time coming, but after a quick round of feedback from some early friends-and-family testers, <em>Churro: Defender of Darnwood</em> now has a <a href="https://offthebooksgames.itch.io/churro">prototype up on itch.io</a>!</p>
      <p>The build contains a single intro level that loops after you complete it. All told probably 5 minutes of gameplay if we&rsquo;re being generous. It&rsquo;s just enough to get a feel for play mechanics, and have a little fun double-jumping and dashing around. If you&rsquo;re curious enough to give the prototype a try, Churro would love to hear what you think.</p>
      <p><img src="/blog/media/churro-yarn.jpg" alt="Churro, as a swatch of realistic knit fabric. This was my skill with &ldquo;Photoshopping&rdquo; at work, a real knit Churro does not yet exist." /></p>
      <p>Donations are available if anyone is excited enough to want to contribute to development. However, please do <strong>not</strong> feel bad bypassing &ldquo;donate&rdquo; to download. It&rsquo;s a very brief glimpse, and not what I&rsquo;d expect anybody to part with hard earned money to play.</p>
      <p>Very thankful for anyone who takes interest, and would be glad to hear any feedback you might have.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>Dots and lines brought the first video games to life, leaving the heavy lifting to our imaginations. Today, trillions of operations bring linear algebra to bear on unsuspecting triangles every second, giving incredible fidelity to the state of the art.</p>
      <p>Graphics and gameplay evolved together, but each has a distinct lineage. Yesterday&rsquo;s platforms have a lot of life left in them, and decades of innovation in game design surface in retro games every week. There are also more ways to play older games than ever before. It’s a bright day for fans of retro games.</p>
      <p>Much work has gone into replicating older games precisely for nostalgia and preservation. Shaders can recreate the look of CRT and LCD screens well. Nintendo Switch Online and FPGA consoles like Analogue Pocket have display modes for this. Even more options are available for emulators, so players can get the look they remember from that 13 inch Zenith in their childhood basement.</p>
      <p>We <em>should</em> have ways to play games designed for CRT screens that reflect their original experiences, but modern pixel art games have a wide opening for new artistic expressions. While occasional 3D games get a unique and naturalistic treatment, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ōkami">Ōkami</a> being a standout example, few pixel art games go beyond nearest-neighbor upscaling apart from occasional CRT or scanline shaders.</p>
      <p>Years ago, while browsing my feeds, I came across a meme with cross-stitched artwork. The specifics of the post didn’t stick, but what <em>did</em> was how similar cross-stitching and pixel art are. Cross-stitched artwork has a quaint and endearing quality, and it’s never criticized for its low resolution.</p>
      <p>One day curiosity got the better of me, and I mocked up some concepts to visualize my realization. Some options I considered were crocheted fabric, glass tiles, or other tile/masonry patterns, but ultimately I felt like cross-stitching and knit fabric would be the most recognizable. Below are some of my early tests. The Link&rsquo;s Awakening tests are 720p, an upscale of 5x (zoom in for detail).</p>
      <p><img src="/blog/media/ladx-cross-stitch.png" alt="Mockup of a cross-stitch upscaled frame from Link&rsquo;s Awakening DX." /></p>
      <p><img src="/blog/media/ladx-knit-fabric.png" alt="Mockup of a knit fabric upscaled frame from Link&rsquo;s Awakening DX." /></p>
      <p><img src="/blog/media/mm2-knit-fabric.png" alt="Mockup of a knit fabric upscaled frame from Mega Man 2 for NES." /></p>
      <p>First takeaway was that smaller input dimensions had better results. Game Boy frames at 160 x 144 could sell the effect better than 256 x 240 NES screens. Also, the knit pattern appeared more distinct than the cross-stitched look at these sizes. Perhaps due to the alternating pattern between neighboring pixels.</p>
      <p>Some of my favorite recent gaming experiences have been wholesome and cozy titles, and I&rsquo;ve been wanting to create something similarly comforting and approachable. A warm knit sweater really meshes with their chill vibe. This was exactly the tone I had in mind for Churro&rsquo;s Pico-8 project I had been tinkering with, so that was an obvious next mockup.</p>
      <p><img src="/blog/media/churro-knit-test.gif" alt="Animated walk cycle of Churro, a little yellow bird, testing a manually applied upscale to look like knit fabric." /></p>
      <p>This look was more compelling to me than the purely pixel art based project I&rsquo;d been working on, and I&rsquo;d recently been getting acquainted with <a href="https://godotengine.org">Godot</a>. The tools and editor would make building a lot faster. After a bit of tinkering, a shader for this knit look had become pretty convincing after just a few evenings. After arriving at specs to help heighten the look (160 x 90 pixels, with sound and colors inspired by the NES), and working out some early details in test levels, some friends suggested finding a way to make the game thematically match the aesthetic.</p>
      <p><img src="/blog/media/churro-moonlight.jpg" alt="Churro, in-engine standing on a tree branch in the moonlight, pixels upscaled to appear like knit fabric." /></p>
      <p>Introducing <em>Churro: Defender of Darnwood</em>, a warm-and-fuzzy retro platformer. There is a lot still in flux about the game, but there are some fun play mechanics, a few rudimentary tilesets, sound effects, and songs for two of the worlds. There is a light story scenario planned, typical of platform games, and a number of in-progress designs for different pests, hazards, and bosses. What follows is an external link to a short teaser, with a first look at the progress on the visuals and the first test level. It&rsquo;s been fun sharing about development, and I wanted to be able to share progress without continuing to obscure the style.</p>
      <p><a href="https://youtu.be/X0-3ERNDhko" class="center-text"><img src="/blog/media/churro-youtube-teaser.jpg" alt="watch the teaser" />watch the teaser</a></p>
      <p>I&rsquo;m not expecting to be able to stick to a rigid timeline, especially working in my free hours. Frankly, I&rsquo;m not even sure what platforms to target a release for, but this project will be the primary focus of my game development time for the foreseeable future.</p>
      <p>The indie community online has been such a fun and welcoming space as I get back into game development, particularly on Mastodon.

    <title>Churro&#8217;s Awakening</title>

      <![CDATA[<p>The active project around here is a 2D retro platform game starring <em>Churro</em>, an eight-by-eight pixel birdie. Unless you&rsquo;ve been following <em>Off The Books</em> elsewhere, you probably haven&rsquo;t seen her around before. Here&rsquo;s some background on our feathered heroine to get you up to speed.</p>
      <p><img class="pixel" src="/blog/media/churro-blink.png" alt="Yellow pixel-art bird." /></p>
      <p>Her first design came from reviving an old project, <em><a href="https://offthebooks.games/build-a-bird">Build-A-Bird</a></em>. During <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird">Flappy Bird&rsquo;s</a></em> peak popularity, every app store was being flooded with clones. It was everywhere, and I had the idea to parody the act of making clones itself. Letting people supply images for the main components of the game, they could create their own clone with little effort. It also was a chance to test the mobile web as a game platform. The initial game had bland artwork, intending to nudge you into supplying your own, but few people bothered to participate in the gag.</p>
      <p>Back in March, it occurred to me that <em>Build-a-Bird</em> would be fun to bring back. JavaScript had come a long way over the last ten years, and while the project is mostly a series of game dev anti-patterns, it was pretty easy to clean up. Because very few people had used their own images, adding friendlier default art felt like a way to make the game more approachable. I had recently worked with low color 8x8 tiles while <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@OffTheBooks/111970184615755837">exploring NES development</a>, and Churro was first pecked out in a custom tile editor (a topic for another day), using colors from the NES palette.</p>
      <p><img src="/blog/media/build-a-bird-screen.png" alt="Screen capture from Build-a-Bird game." /></p>
      <p>Churro&rsquo;s name and her first few animations came while exploring <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">PICO-8</a>. Trying to start up a project for the NES had been fun, but it was clear that building a new game there would carry some heavy costs. With limited time for development, other platforms deserved a look. Hosting many simple retro games, and carrying similar low spec art requirements, I thought PICO-8 was a good place to start.</p>
      <p>Working with PICO-8 one weekend coincidentally lined up with a <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/55/">Ludum Dare</a> game jam. Despite not fitting the theme or completing a project, &ldquo;jamming&rdquo; at the same time as other game developers was energizing. <em>Chirpy Churro</em> ended up being little more than a single stage demo, but Churro seemed right at home as a platform game protagonist. Even those early gameplay mechanics were enjoyable, which was a great first spark for the project. If it&rsquo;s fun to simply move around in a game, that&rsquo;s more than half the battle.</p>

      <p>Quickly, ambitions for what a game with Churro could look like pushed against some of PICO-8&rsquo;s constraints. Even though a low spec game is still the plan, some of the harder limitations and lack of robust tools were going to hold some of the best ideas back.</p>
      <p>Recent interactions with developers online brought along a lot of exposure to <a href="https://godotengine.org">Godot</a>, an open-source engine. It&rsquo;s overwhelmingly well regarded by people who work with it. Most of my previous experience has been with custom engines, but Godot comes with a full toolset that makes getting started really quick. After watching some tutorials and doing some tinkering, a test level was up and running in just a few hours.</p>
      <p>Godot is a fully featured engine with a fantastic system for composing game objects using nodes in a scene tree, and it has a large and growing support community. The repository and first commits for Churro&rsquo;s latest incarnation went up on June 28th, and it&rsquo;s carrying the most momentum on a personal project I&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
      <p>There&rsquo;s no target date or roadmap yet, but there are more fun things yet to show about the project. If a chill retro platformer is in your wheelhouse, it should be fun to follow along. Apart from the blog, you can find a few social accounts to help keep tabs on progress <a href="https://offthebooks.games">here</a>.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the Off The Books Blog. Here you&rsquo;ll find posts on the video game industry, development progress, and related anecdotes.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s 2024, do we really still do blogs?&rdquo; Frankly, there aren&rsquo;t enough of them. Sometimes, writing needs a little space to breathe, a moment to calm itself down, and something sturdier than the ever shifting sands of social media.</p>
      <p>There are fun things ahead to share, and leaving behind some additional context for posterity feels worth the effort.</p>
      <p>In any case, thanks for dropping by, and hope to see you again soon!</p>]]>

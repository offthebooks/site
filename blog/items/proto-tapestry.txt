It's been a long time coming, but after a quick round of feedback from some early friends-and-family testers, <em>Churro: Defender of Darnwood</em> now has a <link|https://offthebooksgames.itch.io/churro|prototype up on itch.io>!

The build contains a single intro level that loops after you complete it. All told probably 5 minutes of gameplay if we're being generous. It's just enough to get a feel for play mechanics, and have a little fun double-jumping and dashing around. If you're curious enough to give the prototype a try, Churro would love to hear what you think.

Donations are available if anyone is excited enough to want to contribute to development. However, please do <strong>not</strong> feel bad bypassing "donate" to download. It's a very brief glimpse, and not what I'd expect anybody to part with hard earned money to play.

Very thankful for anyone who takes interest, and would be glad to hear any feedback you might have.

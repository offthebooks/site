      <p>Welcome to the Off The Books Blog. Here you&rsquo;ll find posts on the video game industry, development progress, and related anecdotes.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s 2024, do we really still do blogs?&rdquo; Frankly, there aren&rsquo;t enough of them. Sometimes, writing needs a little space to breathe, a moment to calm itself down, and something sturdier than the ever shifting sands of social media.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Is there something that should be happening here?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>There are fun things ahead to share, and leaving behind some additional context for posterity feels worth the effort.</p>
      <p>In any case, thanks for dropping by, and hope to see you again soon!</p>

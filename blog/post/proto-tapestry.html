      <p>It&rsquo;s been a long time coming, but after a quick round of feedback from some early friends-and-family testers, <em>Churro: Defender of Darnwood</em> now has a <a href="https://offthebooksgames.itch.io/churro">prototype up on itch.io</a>!</p>
      <p>The build contains a single intro level that loops after you complete it. All told probably 5 minutes of gameplay if we&rsquo;re being generous. It&rsquo;s just enough to get a feel for play mechanics, and have a little fun double-jumping and dashing around. If you&rsquo;re curious enough to give the prototype a try, Churro would love to hear what you think.</p>

      <p>Donations are available if anyone is excited enough to want to contribute to development. However, please do <strong>not</strong> feel bad bypassing &ldquo;donate&rdquo; to download. It&rsquo;s a very brief glimpse, and not what I&rsquo;d expect anybody to part with hard earned money to play.</p>
      <p>Very thankful for anyone who takes interest, and would be glad to hear any feedback you might have.</p>
